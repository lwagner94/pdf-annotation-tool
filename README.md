This simple, proof-of-concept tool allows 
users to annotate PDF documents in their browsers.
Automatic annotations - e.g. based on font style - are available
as well.

## How to run
The simplest was to run the tool is to use `docker-compose`.

Simply run 
```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose run
```
